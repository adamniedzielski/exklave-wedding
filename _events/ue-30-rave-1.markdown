# Ü30 Rave #1

### How old do you have to be to attend?

Despite the party name everyone is welcome, regardless of age. Younger attendees are encouraged to wear ear protection, and older to bring Club Mate.

### Can I bring food or drinks with me?

Yes! That's even encouraged, because I'm not able to provide one banana and 5 liters of water per person. The food and drinks provided will range from non-existent to heavily limited.

###  Who is playing?

The line-up [was secret](https://soundcloud.com/adam_slow_unofficial).

### What if I want to bring a companion with me?
Sure, go for it.

### What if it is raining?

I'm praying for nice weather.

### Can I bring a birthday gift?

No. If you feel the need to do something nice for me please donate to [Himmelbeet](https://himmelbeet.de/spenden)
